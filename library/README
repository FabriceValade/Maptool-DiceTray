This add on give you frame (A dice tray) that allow you to roll dices
to start it, call [macro("diceTrayLoader@lib:DiceTray"):0] or [macro("diceTrayOverlay@lib:DiceTray"):0] anywhere. This will load the frame or the overlay.

The dice tray automatically post all action on it to the maptool chat. You have a small windows between actions that makes it so they are grouped.
The arrow pillbox at the right open a small "memory" that allow you to store dice group for easy access. These are associated to your player name and are stored in the library data

This is a very  early release. Mostly to test and play. If you got any advice/idea/feedback feel free to hit me up on discord lethargie#9412
